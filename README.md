# Music History

This is the final iteration of the Music History web app. Music History is a basic music library that allows a user to add, view, and remove music. The project can be viewed at http://sarah-story.github.io/angular-music-history. 

It is connected to the Spotify API so that the user can search for and listen to music. The app was built using AngularJS and it utilizes RequireJS. I used features from [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) so I used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile the project to ES5.
